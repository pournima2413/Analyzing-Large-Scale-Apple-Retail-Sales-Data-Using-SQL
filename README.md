## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase advanced SQL querying techniques through the analysis of over 1 million rows of Apple retail sales data. The dataset includes information about products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across various Apple retail locations globally. By tackling a variety of questions, from basic to complex, you'll demonstrate your ability to write sophisticated SQL queries that extract valuable insights from large datasets.

The project is ideal for data analysts looking to enhance their SQL skills by working with a large-scale dataset and solving real-world business questions.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## Database Schema

The project uses five main tables:

1. **stores**: Contains information about Apple retail stores.
   - `store_id`: Unique identifier for each store.
   - `store_name`: Name of the store.
   - `city`: City where the store is located.
   - `country`: Country of the store.

2. **category**: Holds product category information.
   - `category_id`: Unique identifier for each product category.
   - `category_name`: Name of the category.

3. **products**: Details about Apple products.
   - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `product_name`: Name of the product.
   - `category_id`: References the category table.
   - `launch_date`: Date when the product was launched.
   - `price`: Price of the product.

4. **sales**: Stores sales transactions.
   - `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.
   - `sale_date`: Date of the sale.
   - `store_id`: References the store table.
   - `product_id`: References the product table.
   - `quantity`: Number of units sold.

5. **warranty**: Contains information about warranty claims.
   - `claim_id`: Unique identifier for each warranty claim.
   - `claim_date`: Date the claim was made.
   - `sale_id`: References the sales table.
   - `repair_status`: Status of the warranty claim (e.g., Paid Repaired, Warranty Void).

## Objectives

The project is split into three tiers of questions to test SQL skills of increasing complexity:

### Easy to Medium (10 Questions)

1. Find the number of stores in each country.
```sql
SELECT 
	country,
	COUNT(store_id) as total_stores
FROM stores
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```  
2. Calculate the total number of units sold by each store.
```sql
SELECT 
	s.store_id,
	st.store_name,
	SUM(s.quantity) as total_unit_sold

GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```
3. Identify how many sales occurred in December 2023.

	COUNT(sale_id) as total_sale 
FROM sales
WHERE TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'MM-YYYY') = '12-2023'
```
4. Determine how many stores have never had a warranty claim filed.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stores

						);
```
5. Calculate the percentage of warranty claims marked as "Warranty Void".
```sql
SELECT 
	ROUND
